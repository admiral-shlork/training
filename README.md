## Notes
* AMRAP - As Many Reps As Possible
* Rest:
   * 30-40 seconds between warmup sets (or as long as it takes to change the weight on the bar)
   * 1-3 minutes between working sets (depending on the exercise, whether it's the beginnning or end of the training etc.)
* Add:
    * 1kg to squat, every training
    * 2kg to deadlift, every training
    * 0.5kg to bench press, every training
    * 0.5kg to overhead press, every training
    * 0.5kg to row, every week
    * 0.5kg to biceps curl, every training
    * 10 seconds to plank, every 2-4 weeks
* If you fail to make 5 reps in the last set, remove 10% of the target weight on the next training and progress as before
* Warmup sets:
    * Start with 40-60% of target weight
    * Progressively add 10-15% every warmup set
 * Example - squat:
   * Warmup sets: 9x50kg, 6x60kg, 3x70kg;
   * Working sets: 5x80kg, 5x80kg, at least 5x80kg;
* Good form goes without saying

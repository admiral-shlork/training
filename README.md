## Notes
* AMRAP - As Many Reps As Possible
* add:
    * 1kg to squat, every training
    * 2kg to deadlift, every training
    * 0.5kg to bench press, every training
    * 0.5kg to overhead press, every training
    * 0.5kg to row, every week
    * 0.5kg to biceps curl
    * 10 seconds to plank, every 2-3 weeks
* if you fail to make 5 reps in the last set, remove 10% of the target weight on the next training and progress as before
* warmup sets:
    * start with 40-60% of target weight
    * progressively add 10-15% every warmup set
    * example: 
          squat:
            warmup sets: 9x50kg, 6x60kg, 3x70kg;
            working sets: 5x80kg, 5x80kg, at least 5x80kg;

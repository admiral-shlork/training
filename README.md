## Notes
* AMRAP - As Many Reps As Possible
* Rest:
   * 30-40 seconds between warmup sets (or as long as it takes to change the weight on the bar)
   * 1-3 minutes between working sets (depending on the exercise, whether it's the beginnning or end of the training etc.)
* Add:
    * 1kg (2.2lb) to squat, every training
    * 2kg (4.4lb) to deadlift, every training
    * 0.5kg (1.1lb) to bench press, every training
    * 0.5kg (1.1lb) to overhead press, every training
    * 0.5kg (1.1lb) to row, every week
    * 0.5kg (1.1lb) to biceps curl, every week
    * 10 seconds to plank, every 2-4 weeks
* If you fail to make 5 reps in the last set, remove 10% of the target weight on the next training and progress as before.
* Warmup sets:
    * Start with 40-60% of target weight
    * Progressively add about 15% every warmup set
 * Example - squat:
   * Warmup sets: 9x50kg (110lb), 6x60kg (130lb), 3x70kg (155lb);
   * Working sets: 5x80kg (175lb), 5x80kg (175lb), at least 5x80kg (175lb);
* Good form on every rep goes without saying.
